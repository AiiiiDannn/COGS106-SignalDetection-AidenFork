# COGS 106 Assignment: Object Oriented Programming
This repository contains code for an assignment in COGS 106, with the focus being object oriented programming by writing a class in Python that implements signal detection theory. This is a group assignment. All group members have the same version of code by forking from one repository.

### Context on Signal Detection Theory ###
Signal detection theory is a statistical framework for understanding the performance of human observers (or machines) in detecting signals in noise. It provides a mathematical description of how well the observer can discriminate between signal and noise, and how they balance the trade-off between detecting signals and avoiding false alarms.
